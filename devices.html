				With all the data flowing around the world how is it that the data is getting to the right places? Its all thanks to to networking devices such as switches and routers.
				The very versions of networking equipment only repeated data it heard on side to the other, which for its time was great but came at a huge cost lots of needed data was 
				slowing the network down. To solve this problem, bridges (and their multi port relative) were introduced. What they did is learn who was connected to them and only passed 
				data to the computers it only knew and discarded the rest. This was great since allow for faster communication but caused a new problem; a computer that is connected 
				two switches over will not have it data sent outside its immediate area. To solve this problem routers were invented, they combined the principle of switches with addition 
				transporting info across multiple networks. Routers and switches are the main backbone to any network, without them the network will cease to exist. s			</p>
