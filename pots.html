				Did you know the first computers only communicated with models of the same type and this caused serious problems when different organizations wanted to 
				work together on a project. To solve this problem the BBN Technologies company created IMPs (Interface Message Processors) that would allow
				any type of computer to communicate with another.
				<br>
				At the time the only available communicate medium that can be found sll over the US was telephone wires. With that knowledge computer companies
				began to find ways use the available infrastructure to there advantage by passing computer data over telephone lines. Eventually the telephone 
				companies caught on and began charge premium prices for better speeds.
