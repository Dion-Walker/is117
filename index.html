				When most people think of the Internet they will assume you are talking about websites, video streaming services, music radios
				and social media forums. The idea of an internetwork of computers was the vision of a man named J.C. Licklider. He envision a
				network of computers that can communicate to each no matter where it is located or who manufactured the machine. He created the 
				Intergalatic Computer Network, which at the time connected computers over existing POTS lines then was eventually upgrade to coaxial
				cable.
				<br>
				ARPANet was the evolution to thet Intergalatic Computer Network and allowed the government enitity know as ARAP (Advanced Research 
				Projects Agency) to work on network computers that were located throughout the country. Not only did ARPANet provide network communication
				it also provided a robust communication outlet in the event that the nation was attacked data communication between all computers was not halted.
