				Today we can get anything and everything with the click of a button but image if suddenly the network connection between your favorite internet 
				store and your Internet provider was lost would happen? Actually nothing will happen thanks to packet switching. Packet switching was the brain child 
				of two men, Paul Baran and Donald Davies. They thought of a way to transport large information in smaller chunks aka packets which were then routed to 
				the fastest and most reliable path to the destination.
				<br>
				Packet switching was so efficient at networking that it was adopted immediately by the US Air Force since it was able to provide the following three key 
				elements: it allowed for a decentralized network which could communicate over several network paths thus making it robust, it uses a form of send and receive 
				for data like a post office and broke large information into smaller pieces to be put together once it was received.

					TCP/IP and Ethernet use packet switching for data communication.
