				Before cell phones, tablets and laptops the only way to connect to the Internet was over a wire. In the beginning it you use to have multiple telephone lines
				hooked up to one computer but over time this began to get expensive, hard to manage and performed extremely slow. So to provide some help many people began to 
				use coaxial cables which was cheap and provided faster speeds than your typical telephone line but came with a huge flaw; if the coaxial cable was damaged in any
				way all data communications sieze to stop over that wire. So back to drawing board, this time a product that was as flexible as telephone wire but robust as coax 
				was created and it was called Ethernet. Ethernet which came in 1972 is still being used today by every computer networked deviced.
				<br>
				Ethernet connects via RJ-45 and rovides data communication over copper wires. The great thing about Ethernet is it comes in two types UTP (Unshield Twisted Pairs) 
				and STP (Shield Twisted Pairs). Depending on how you plan to deploy your network will determine which one you will use. Ethernet is very durable and can be bent in 
				different angles and still provide network connectivity. The only downfall with Ethernet is it suffer attenuation, which means after a certain distance the speed at 
				which data travels begins to slow down over long distances.
